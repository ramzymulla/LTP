# LTP Python Library

This is a python library I developed during my work in Dr. Heidi Kloefkorn's Lab at Oregon State University. The motivation for this project was to automate the extraction of basic waveform features (i.e., fEPSP Amplitude, 10-40% Slope) from evoked activity I recorded from mouse CA3-CA1 synapses while studying long-term potentiation (LTP).
