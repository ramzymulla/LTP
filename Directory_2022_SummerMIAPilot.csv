Summer 2022 MIA Pilot Electro Physiology Directory ,,,,,,,,,
"* On 12/13/2022 B22L name was changed and reorganized. Annotated slice images were scanned and reannotated by Angel Rose Villegas. The originial physical copy resides in the ""Lab Notebook"" drawer in the Kloefkorn Lab. The Harddrive resides in Desk 24 of Johnson 307. ",,,,,,,,,
"* On 3/31/2023 New slice image and stim search scans were taken, and the stim channels/strengths were updated for B22R_RHS1, with B22R_LHS2 being added to the directory as well (Ramzy)",,,,,,,,,
* On 4/4/2023 raw files were renamed with date for consistency and tracing. Data Analysis files were moved to each animals respective folder,,,,,,,,,
